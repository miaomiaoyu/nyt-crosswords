# NYT Crosswords

This script automates the downloading of the New York Times Crosswords puzzles and their solutions from the Seattle Times website*. It uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the web page and store the downloaded puzzles in PDF format.

*The crosswords on Seattle Times are 5 weeks behind current date.

## Features

- Downloads the daily crossword puzzle and solution in PDF format.
- Supports headless browsing to run the script without opening a browser window.
- Automatically creates the specified download directory if it does not exist.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miaomiaoyu/nyt-crosswords.git
   cd nyt-crosswords
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal, replacing `path/to/download/directory` with your desired directory (defaults to './downloads' if not specified.):

```bash
python3 run.py --download_dir `path/to/download/directory`
```

### To set script up to run automatically

```bash
chmod +x run.py
```

## How It Works

1. The script navigates to the [Seattle Times crossword page](https://nytsyn.pzzl.com/cwd_seattle/).
2. It finds the print button for the puzzle and solution, clicks on it, and downloads the corresponding PDF files.
3. It saves the downloaded files in the specified directory, using today's date and day of the week in the file names.
